### Hello everyone! 👋

I'm a data analyst/enginner specialized in areas such as BI and automation. Currently, developing data engineering and automatization projects. I'm always learning, and I love to test myself, currently sharping my GIS skills 🌍

Aditionally, I love to be involved in projects among the tech community. I have collaborated with Omdena, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap, and EFC; where I contribute in an international environment of people making a positive impact using technology ⚡

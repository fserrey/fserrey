### Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data analyst specialized in areas such as sustainability ðŸŒ±, BI, and automation. Currently, developing data engineering and automatization projects. I'm always learning, and I love to test myself in other fields.

At the moment, I'm a volunteer at organizations such as Omdena, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap, and EFC; where I collaborate with an international community of people making a positive impact using technology âš¡

Thanks you to drop by my Github!
